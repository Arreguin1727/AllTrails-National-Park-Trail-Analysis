# AllTrails-National-Park-Trail-Analysis
A Python Exploratory Analysis of the online app, AllTrails. This project investigated user data and tested a hypothesis focused on what metrics make a National Park Trail more popular than another in the app. 

Executive Summary: AllTrailsÂ  is a mobile fitness app used for outdoor recreational activities. It maps and tracks the usage of trails in many of the National Parks throughout the United States. Users are able to see the location of trailheads, utilize gps tracking, and compare  a variety of other metrics including: 
  - mileage
  - elevation gain
  - trail activities (ex: bird watching)
  - trail features (ex: waterfall)
  - popularity
  - overall difficulty
  - average rating
  - photos uploaded by users

This analysis will delve into AllTrails user data collected in 2019 to investigate a variety of metrics and identify themes, specifically looking at trail density throughout the US and the characteristics that affect a trails popularity.
